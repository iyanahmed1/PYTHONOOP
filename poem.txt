In the realm where code and logic dance,  
Python weaves its quiet trance,  
A language sleek with elegance,  
Unfolds its charm in every glance.

With syntax clear, concise, and bright,  
It turns the dark to pure delight,  
Indentations mark the flow,  
A gentle guide where ideas grow.

From simple scripts to grand designs,  
It bridges gaps, it intertwines,  
With modules rich and libraries vast,  
It shapes the future from the past.

In loops and lists, in functions pure,  
It solves the riddles, makes them sure,  
The 'def' and 'class', the 'import' too,  
In Python’s world, the sky’s the hue.

For data’s dance, for web’s embrace,  
For science bold, it finds its place,  
A language built to understand,  
To craft and build with skillful hand.

O Python, with your grace so fine,  
You turn the complex into rhyme,  
In every line, your spirit sings,  
A symphony of logic’s wings.
